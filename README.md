SAMPLE TEST PROGRAM
1. Queue Basics
Queue: A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) data structure used to store tasks or items that need to be processed.
put(item): Adds an item to the queue.
get(): Removes and returns an item from the queue.
2. Producer-Consumer Pattern
This pattern is used to decouple the production of data (tasks) from its consumption (processing), enabling multiple producer and consumer threads to operate concurrently.

Producers: Threads that generate data or tasks and put them into the queue.
Consumers: Threads that retrieve and process data or tasks from the queue.
3. Synchronization
queue.Queue provides thread-safe operations, meaning multiple threads can safely put and get items without additional synchronization mechanisms.

4. Task Completion and Coordination
task_done(): Signals that a previously get-ed task is complete. This is crucial when coordinating multiple consumer threads to ensure all tasks are processed.
join(): Blocks until all tasks in the queue have been marked as done using task_done(). This is used to wait for all tasks to be processed.
5. Clean Shutdown with Sentinel Values
A common technique for stopping consumer threads is using sentinel values (e.g., None). Producers put these values into the queue to signal consumers to exit.
